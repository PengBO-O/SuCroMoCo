$amzn re-post-- again- if you missed this dwyer is 10000% correct the fed should not of raised in december and with inflation still running well below their mandate; in the face of tariffs that are inflationary have been in place yet inflation is still below target why didn t powell cut bizarre in fact the best question at that news conference- if you re projecting a rate cut in future won t many investors hold off for lower rates🧐🧐. so by the feds very approach they just might be creating further slowdown if i were trump- i d be bullshit this fight with the world to make better deals for us- the american people- could of been made easier with a normal thinking fed so who benefits is trump wins all these trade battles even a dumb democrat should know thst answer wanting to see trump fail is analogous to wanting to see your home country fail where s the lie	1

$bynd some people want to short it now. because it s overvalued obviously but my case and point is $tlry this is simple basic supply and demand. - the stock has a 9.6 mm float. - 50% short interest over 80% costs - they got a good pr team. - multiple outlets. - $mcd ceo on the board of bynd - sold in retailer across the world like wholefoods aka $amzn - huge spike in brand recognition. - so why short it now unless it s a scalp take the short when the lock up expires and just go on a vacation until the dilution the selling should have stopped. i rather take the easy trade. fd: i m still long from 66s use common sense and a sl obviously i wouldn t recommend holding a overnight short and its squeezed so many shorts out. some furu s were screaming short at 60s and took a nasty loss.	1

$baba all out of dry powder now. good news is i picked up some more on the way down and at 168. i m done posting for today. hope altaba stops selling by 12 est or earlier on low volume. hope its a bear trap too. never get emotional. you win some you lose some but this is by far one of the most undervalued stocks on the market. atleast 30-40% upside in the next year. i ve been an alibaba member since 2004 and can t tell you how huge this has become. gl to everyone	1

$sbux news is totally overblown. a manager should have handled the situation not a barista. starbucks is a great company and the situation will be fixed. people somwhow forget starbucks got sh for calling police over a noncustomer for loitering and using the bathroom and they tried to paint starbucks as racist. now they want to paint them as anticop. so called conservstives are turning out to be as whiny as liberals. btw up 85% in a year because customers care about good coffee not stupid incidents like these that happen in every fast food chain every year almost daily that you never hear about.	1

$tsla i hate the term squeeze because i don t wish upon anyone that they lose their hard earned money and i find the dialectic of pro and con very intellectually barren. but what is happening is that there are 40 million people betting this stock will go down which is like 30% of total stock ownership. if the stock skyrockets they will be out a lot of money. so we are approaching a tipping point soon where those folks will buy driving up the price. i didn t even understand short selling and couldn t believe it s legal. i had to watch multiple youtube videos to even understand how it works. fundamentally the idea of making fortunes on another s loss is not for me. but i concord that there is going to be a short squeeze for the ages when it happens because when the story of the company the story of the stock become double arrows in opposite directions that s what hapoens. the arc of the stock will bend towards the reality of the company. but again i don t wish anyone any $ harm.	1

"$work i m loving the majority of the reactions in here. market psychology. thanks for creating buying opportunity for me. what percentage of you have even used slack in the workplace and actually know something about the company and what percentage of you simply just bought in on a ""hot"" ipo slack is the future of office communication and much much more when you consider all the applets it integrates with. the market has already shown that there is room for innovation and new players in the world of pc software and apps and everything doesn t have to come from $msft. in fact i d argue that slack has much more appeal than microsoft s offerings and appeals more especially to the younger generation of workers. slack has already become a verb just like $goog"	1
